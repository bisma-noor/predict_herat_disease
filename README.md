Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. It includes synthetic data generation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and comparison using multiple ML algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Key steps include:

Visualizing feature correlations and target distribution

Training models on standardized data

Evaluating using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualizing performance comparison and confusion matrix

The best-performing model is selected based on F1-score and further analyzed using a classification report and confusion matrix.
